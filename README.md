Purpose for this  program was to create a useful applicaiton which would scrape the weather off the internet and put it in a .csv or excel file. It would make a clean lay out of the 7 day forcast and list the description of the weather and the High or Low of the Temperature. 

Key Concepts I used in this program was learnign to parse the html file using requests and beautiful soup library. This allowed me to understand the bridge between HTML and Python. Another concept I learned was learned was the Pandas libray which formats the python code data from get_text() into a readble table display.
